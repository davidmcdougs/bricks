## Getting Started

make sure you have node installed.

 if you're on windows, install git bash, or you will need to download this as a zip file instead.

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bupedev/typescript-p5js-boilerplate.git <your_project_name>
cd <your_project_name>
```
*Skip this step if you just download it as a zip file


You can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will package your code and start a local server at `http://localhost:8080/`.
